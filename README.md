===

This repo groups ROS packages for using open-source tools (such as [HPP](https://humanoid-path-planner.github.io/hpp-doc/) and [TSID](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/tsid)) to control the robots at Paris Robotics Lab :
 * [prl_hpp](prl_hpp/README.md) : Provides "simple" interfaces for using [HPP](https://humanoid-path-planner.github.io/hpp-doc/) with robots, aswell as some examples.
 * [prl_tsid](prl_tsid/README.md) : Provides "simple" interfaces for using [TSID](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/tsid) with robots, aswell as some examples.
 * [prl_pinocchio](prl_pinocchio/README.md) : make the bridge between the robot ROS interfaces and the concept of a robot for pinocchio (and pinocchio-based tools).
